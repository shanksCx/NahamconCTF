```
Before the pages changed,  
before the records grew noisy,  
there was our first trace.

Find it.  
Mark the moment; to the second.
```

You just have to go to 
```
web.archive.org
```

and search for` ctf.nahamcon.com`

![2](<images/Pasted image 20251218084315.png>)

click the oldest entry you can find clearly 2020 right here 
![3](<images/Pasted image 20251218084414.png>)

choose the oldest date which seems to be `7th June`
![4](<images/Pasted image 20251218084515.png>)

click the timestamp on it `10:32:17`

![5](<images/Pasted image 20251218084616.png>)

 and the url looks something like:
 ```
 https://web.archive.org/web/20200617045449/https://ctf.nahamcon.com/
 ```

notice the  `20200617045449`

which translates to `2020-06-17 04:54:49` . Notice it really isn't June 7,2020 that we had clicked but that means that it was a false alarm . Looking at `web.archive.org` once more we do see this 
`2020-06-17 04:54:49` as the next earliest timestamp 
![6](<images/Pasted image 20251218085502.png>)

so we got the flag :
``` 
flag{20200617045449}

```
