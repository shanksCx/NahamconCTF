```
Before the pages changed,  
before the records grew noisy,  
there was our first trace.

Find it.  
Mark the moment; to the second.
```

You just have to go to 
```
web.archive.org
```

and search for` ctf.nahamcon.com`

![[Pasted image 20251218084315.png]]

click the oldest entry you can find clearly 2020 right here 
![[Pasted image 20251218084414.png]]

choose the oldest date which seems to be `7th June`
![[Pasted image 20251218084515.png]]

click the timestamp on it `10:32:17`

![[Pasted image 20251218084616.png]]
 and the url looks something like:
 ```
 https://web.archive.org/web/20200617045449/https://ctf.nahamcon.com/
 ```

notice the  `20200617045449`

which translates to `2020-06-17 04:54:49` . Notice it really isn't June 7.,2020 that we had clicked but that means that it was a false alarm . Looking at `web.archive.org` once more we do see this 
`2020-06-17 04:54:49` as the next earliest timestamp 
![[Pasted image 20251218085502.png]]

so we got the flag :
``` 
flag{20200617045449}

```
